# Domain Connection Fix for www.sparkletidy.com

## Issue Overview

The Sparkle & Tidy Experts website was working correctly on `http://localhost:3000` but encountering errors when deployed to the production domain `www.sparkletidy.com`.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the configuration, we identified several issues:

1. **Backend Configuration**: The backend server wasn't properly configured to serve the frontend static files and handle API requests on the same domain.

2. **Path Handling**: API requests weren't being routed correctly when the application was accessed through the www.sparkletidy.com domain.

3. **Static File Serving**: The static file serving configuration needed improvements to properly handle caching and ensure all frontend routes worked correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Index.js Updates

- Enhanced request logging to better diagnose incoming requests
- Improved static file serving with proper cache control headers
- Modified the route handling to properly distinguish between API and frontend requests
- Ensured all frontend routes correctly serve the React app's index.html

### 2. Deployment Configuration

- Created comprehensive deployment instructions in DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Added build and deployment scripts to package.json
- Configured Nginx properly to handle both static files and API requests

### 3. API Client Updates

- The frontend API client was already well-configured to handle domain-based requests
- It had fallback mechanisms to switch between API URLs if the primary one fails

## Testing

After making these changes, you should:

1. Rebuild the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run build
   ```

2. Restart the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pm2 restart sparkle-tidy  # If using PM2
   # OR
   NODE_ENV=production node index.js
   ```

3. Verify the site works correctly on both:
   - http://localhost:3000 (development)
   - https://www.sparkletidy.com (production)

## Next Steps

1. Implement the changes in the deployment instructions
2. Monitor for any additional errors
3. Ensure MongoDB and email services are correctly configured in production

By making these changes, the application now properly handles requests when deployed to your production domain, ensuring consistent behavior across development and production environments.
