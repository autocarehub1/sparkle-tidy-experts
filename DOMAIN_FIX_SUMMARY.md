## Domain URL Fix Summary

### Changes Made:

1. Created a centralized configuration file at `src/config.js` to manage API and APP URLs based on environment
2. Updated server/index.js to use environment-based URLs and expanded CORS configuration
3. Created a centralized Axios client to ensure consistent API requests
4. Updated all components to use the centralized configuration and API client
5. Added comprehensive domain checking script (check-domain.sh) for troubleshooting

### How to Test:

1. Run locally: `NODE_ENV=development npm run dev`
2. Verify domain connectivity: `./check-domain.sh`
3. Deploy to production with: `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`

### Next Steps:

1. Ensure proper DNS configuration on your Hostinger account for sparkletidy.com and www.sparkletidy.com
2. Install and configure SSL certificates on your server
3. Configure proper NGINX or Apache to handle redirects from HTTP to HTTPS
4. Regularly monitor domain connectivity using the check-domain.sh script
