# Migration Summary for Hostinger

## What We've Created

We've prepared a comprehensive backup package for your Sparkle & Tidy Experts web application that addresses Hostinger's requirements for both website files and database. The package includes:

1. **Complete Source Code**: All frontend and backend code files
2. **MongoDB Database Backup**: Located in the `/database-backup` directory
3. **Production Build**: Pre-built optimized React application in the `/build` directory
4. **Documentation**:
   - `HOSTINGER_README.md`: Quick overview for the migration team
   - `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`: Detailed deployment instructions
   - `MONGODB_SETUP.md`: MongoDB database setup guide
   - `PM2_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Instructions for PM2 process management

## What to Submit to Hostinger

1. Upload the `sparkle-tidy-experts-complete-backup.zip` file to Hostinger
2. In your migration request, specify:
   - This is a **MERN stack application** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
   - It requires Node.js hosting with MongoDB database support
   - The backup includes both website files and database
   - Direct them to read the `HOSTINGER_README.md` file first

## Important Notes for Hostinger

Make sure to emphasize these points in your communication with Hostinger:

1. This is **NOT a WordPress site** and cannot be migrated using WordPress tools
2. The application requires a Node.js hosting environment
3. MongoDB database setup is required (as detailed in `MONGODB_SETUP.md`)
4. The `.env` file will need to be updated with Hostinger-specific settings
5. **PM2 Configuration**: The server should be started using `server/index.js`, not `server/server.js`

## After Migration

Once Hostinger completes the migration, you'll need to:

1. Verify that the MongoDB database is properly set up
2. Update the `.env` file with the correct MongoDB connection string
3. Ensure the Node.js server is running correctly with PM2 (see `PM2_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
4. Test all functionality of the application
